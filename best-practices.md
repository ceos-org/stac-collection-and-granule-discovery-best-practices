# 3. Best Practices

[//]: # (this is a comment)

## 3.1 Introduction

There are three different levels of obligation for the Best Practices presented in the current document:
- “Requirements” are mandatory and must be implemented,
- “Recommendations” are optional, but strongly recommended for interoperability,
- “Optional” indicates an additional good practice.

In addition, "Permissions" indicate allowed deviations from one of more of the underlying specifications in cases where a subset of the original requirements is deemed sufficient in the context of CEOS.



| :question: |  Put general requirements here, applicable to multiple chapters (e.g. common for granule/collection to avoid repetition) ?  |

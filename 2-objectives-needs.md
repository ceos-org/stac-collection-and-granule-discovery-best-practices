## Overview

The set of available STAC and STAC API specifications and their related extensions allow to support many different use cases.  However, the multiple implementation options may cause organizations to implement different subsets of the specifications causing interoperability issues and preventing federation of catalogs provided by different organisations.  The guidelines and recommendations presented in the current document aim to cover a number of recurrent use cases which are described below.  Not all use cases apply to all organisations, but organisations wiht the need to cover one of these use cases should consider the corresponding recommendations.
